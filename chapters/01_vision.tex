\section{Vision \& High-Level Architecture}

\subsection{Business Context \& Goals}
GCBI needs to scale from 1K → 100K+ monthly service interactions with:
\begin{itemize}
  \item End-to-end traceability: Clients → Projects → Invoices
  \item Automated notifications (pricing, shipping, time-tracking)
  \item Unified dashboard of support, billing, and project status
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Proposed Solution}
A lightweight \emph{Integration API} that:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Ingests Zoho webhooks via OAuth2
  \item Publishes events to RabbitMQ
  \item Persists core data in PostgreSQL \& Neo4j
  \item Exposes a unified GraphQL/REST façade
\end{enumerate}
